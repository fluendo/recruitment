1-I believe the main problem that could explain the confusion of the bald linesman's head for the ball is overfitting, in fact, this can be due to the quality of the training 
data as it may lack diversity or not be adapted to different scenarios (for example the case when the ball is in the air and the background is not green grass, or when it gets out
of the pitch and since the "linesman's head" has always grass in the neighborhood this explains the biased training data).
For the evaluation of the model, it feels legitimate  to say that the model was unable to generalize because the model was so true to the training data that didn't have 
diverse scenarios which have made it difficult to deal with challenges like occlusion, change of scale and lightning, background...


2-As a first solution, I choose to act on the training data: make it more diverse, include different scenarios, and make sure that the background is not uniform (not 
just green grass) for the sake of avoiding overfitting and learning how to deal with challenging scenarios like occlusion and change of motion. A negative point about
this may be computational cost and slowing down the training.

As a second solution, I suggest improving annotations, relying for example on automatic methods to do annotation and reduce human error, making use of generative models like diffusion models
to generate fully annotated data, and enriching the dataset with reliable annotations. The drawback may be also about computation resources and how to adapt these generative
models(hyperparameters) to this specific type of problem.

3-A deep learning tracking algorithm suitable for this case of single object tracking is graph based tracker, graphs are very efficient in capturing spatial
information by using multiple CNNs.
