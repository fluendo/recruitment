1-In order to achieve player action recognition, we can use an object detection algorithm like YOLO to locate the players inside the pitch and draw banding
boxes around them.
We can also apply some classification algorithms like Random Forest or SVM that are able to extract color and texture features in order to properly distinguish between 
players from different teams, referees, and coaches.


2-Some potential bottlenecks may this problem encounter is for example occlusion where the model can be confused to distinguish between two players from different
teams because they occlude each other. Another problem is it might be tricky to correctly identify the pose and do the right classification of the action of the player.
