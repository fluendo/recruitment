# Simple License Plate Recognition with Deep Learning by Pawarit Jamjod

Simple architecture (CNNS) are apply to demonstrate the difficulties in the task and diaagnosis where potential improve ment can be made.

## Main

First, generate a synthetic plates and train the model by running

```bash
python3 train.py
```

And test the model on 10 real license plate images by running

```bash
python3 test.py
```

Result when training and testing can be seen in the terminal
